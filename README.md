<h1 align="center"> NotePage</h1>

Note Page was designed with the intention of having an easy to use and reliable page that gives the user complete liberty over what they want to type and how much of it they want to type out. The user's attention should not be diverted by nummberous menus and features and the simple layout of the page which is why the page features little to no additional features outside of the main note storage functionality. The page allows for the user to create their own username and password login and storing specific notes to specific users. You can then load previously saved notes and rewview their contents or, go back and make changes to prexisting notes!

This project was made with the intention of being simple and easy to use so that even I could potentially use it to store either quick one off notes or full on essays.
